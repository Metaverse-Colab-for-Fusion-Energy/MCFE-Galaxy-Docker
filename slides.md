### **Workflows**: a user perspective
### Oliver Woolland (RSE, 2025)

---

# What is a workflow?

---
### My answer ~2022:

#### **Formalised chains of software tools, explicitly defining the flow of data between them.**

- **Abstract**: logic separate to data, remix / compose
- **Automated**: reusable, reproducible, provenance
- **Scalable and portable**: local / HPC, Windows / Linux
- **Shareable and citable**: publishable, create DOIs

---

## What is a workflow *for a user?

Workflows are really about:
- **Enabling research** not installing tools 
- **Doing research** not manually running tools
- **Accelerating research** using HPC / cloud
- **Sharing research** not just reports and papers

---

## So what changed?

I became familiar with Galaxy!

(and spent more time with researchers)

â›” Installing a framework / tool / docker / plugin
âœ… Just use your browser

â›” Installing tools
âœ… Just use your browser
####
â›” YAML / Python / text editor faffing
âœ… Just use (the GUI) in your browser
####
â›” "Yeah you can use my workflow! Clone this repo, install this tool, configure this library, download this file"
âœ… "Just go to [your URL] in your browser"

### "But my workflow engine is **better** ðŸ˜¤"

Well, maybe. But as a group we should pick one.

List of 361 workflow engines:

---

## Why Galaxy is good enough

- Administered by sysadmins not users
- Browser interface is best for users
- Can interfce with HPC
- Has an API
- Actively developed
- Widely adopted

---

# **Can I prove Galaxy is good enough?**

### I think so! 
Let's look at a worked example

---

# Introducing: some linguists

- **Alice** (Masters student) saw a tool online
- **Bob** (PhD student) knows a tool from the literature
- **Charlie** (Postdoc) too busy but has big ideas
- **Dani** (PI) wants research to occur, to show off
- **Me** (pretending to be a sysadmin)

#### Their research aim: 
**To mine data from a database of phrases**

---

## Demo

### Time for chaos

--- 

# What did we see?

- Researchers doing research! 
- Without any setup
- Using tools, making workflows, sharing output

---

## Galaxy's big questions (and my solutions)
<style scoped>
section {

}
</style>

### **Doesn't Galaxy needs a server to set up and maintained?**

### **Doesn't Galaxy make it hard to do local development?**

I thought this for a long time but now have an answer!

Clone this repo for an example **self hosted Galaxy using Docker**

### **Wont the Galaxy server die at the end of my project?**

Well...

## My suggestion

We trail a persistant, central Galaxy instance for RSEs

We put a workstation *under a desk*

---

## How would this look for RSEs?

I would maintain the instance in my personal development time

RSEs can use the demo docker compose and create tools

RSEs can compose workflows to share with academics

No need to nesseceraly learn a new workflow tool, onboarded by fellow RSEs

As well all contribute tools the instance gets stronger, we do less new work

---

```xml
<tool id="letter_count" name="Letter Count" version="0.1.0">
  <description>Counting letters in a string</description>
  
  <requirements>
    <container type="docker">python:3.13-slim</container>
  </requirements>
  
  <command>
    <![CDATA[
      python '$__tool_directory__/letter_count.py' '$input_file' '$output_file'
    ]]>
  </command>

  <inputs>
    <param type="data" name="input_file" label="Sentance File" help="Enter the string to count the letters" />
  </inputs>

  <outputs>
    <data format="txt" name="output_file" label="Letter Count" help="Output file containing the letter count" />
  </outputs>
  
  <help>
    This tool counts the number of letter in each word of a string.
  </help>

</tool>
```

## The future

If the instance too popular and a workstation can't cope:
- Good problem to have!
- Can investigate backing on to HPC / cloud

If it is not:
- Nice workstation for someone

If we don't step up and instance:
- Galaxy is still a good choice for projects!
- The Docker solution makes it easy to get set up and working
- I am happy help anyone that is interested

---

## Conclusions

- Workflows should be about:
  - user experiences
  - enabling research
- Galaxy is good enough 

## We should (gently) start to host our own Galaxy
